### Econ B2000, MA Econometrics

### Kevin R Foster, CCNY

*This first HW has complicated multiple due dates for different parts,
see details below. In general HW are due after each class, where I
usually give you night-owls the option of working until 8am the next
morning.*

*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I’ll put a HW1
channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github
there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the
assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of
your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic
    test by end of the day Friday Sept 24.
3.  *this is due before class* During class on Thursday Sept 2, we’ll do
    experiments on sequences of random numbers. I gave out dice in first
    class, for you to play with sanding, filing, heating, drilling,
    gluing, squeezing or whatever to see if you can adjust which numbers
    come up. Before class, you should have done about 20 experiments
    where you roll the dice and record whether the result was a 6 or
    not.
4.  Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the
    lecture notes *R Basics for Lecture 1* to do some simple stats on
    the Household Pulse data. Those notes request that you find average
    ages for men and women. Tell me something else interesting, that you
    learned from the data. Are there surprises for you? We will use this
    same data for a few exercises so it’s worth getting deeper into it.
5.  Look over Lab 1, to start thinking about what you’re being asked to
    do. We’ll discuss more in class.

*The dice example is from Andrew Gelman’s book on Teaching Stats.*
